# Vaccine_Acceptance_Prediction
Our goal is to predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines
based on past data of 2009. Specifically, predicting two probabilities: one for h1n1_vaccine and 
one for seasonal vaccine. The labels are target variables i.e. h1n1 vaccine and seasonal vaccine 
whereas the 35 features are all the components related to the probability of people for the target 
variable. The evaluation metric is ROC AUC accuracy.
